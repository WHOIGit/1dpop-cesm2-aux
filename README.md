# 1dpop-cesm2-aux

## Auxiliary code for CESM2 1DPOP configuration.

This code includes:

- Restoring of temperature, salinity to climatology
- Restoring of U and V velocities to climatology
- Damping of U and V velocities
- Setting minimum value for Coriolis parameter (f)
- Use climatological temperature, salinity and horizontal velocities fluxes as g-term forcing
